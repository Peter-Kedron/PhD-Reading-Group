# PhD Reading Group


On alternating weeks the plan is to 
1. **Week 1 -** Closely read a single paper that one student has chosen from the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences and then collectively deconstruct that paper and the argument it makes during our weekly meeting.  
2. **Week 2 -** For each student to individually read two papers (one each week) from 'premier' journals that they finding interesting, but are not specifically within their area of specialization. Each student will then briefly present (~5min) the the central ideas of that paper and key ideas, techniques, or writing they found particularly interesting/helpful.
