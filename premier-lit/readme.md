# Papers Individually Selected from 'Premier' Journals

This folder is designed to collect and organize the papers you individually chose to read from preimer journals. The goal here is for you to read broadly across some of the best research available. Please target journals of the highest caliber (e.g., *Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, American Economic Review*). To be clear, these outlets are not the only place high quality research is published. However, these are leading outlets where many of the best scholars are sharing their ideas, and all these outlets are widely read inside and outside academia. We'd like you to get a sense of the range of ideas at the frontier of science.

> Please add the papers you select to read to the running list below, and place a .pdf of the paper in the literature folder. Please index papers as presented below and lead the entry with your last name in bold to indicate that you selected the paper.
