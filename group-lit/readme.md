# Papers Individually Selected for Collective Reading

This folder is designed to collect and organize the papers we will read collectively and discuss in detail together. The goal here is for you to learn to closely read papers in our discipline and then critically deconstruct the argumentation presented. 

> Please add the papers you select to read to the running list below, and place a .pdf of the paper in the literature folder. Please index papers as presented below and lead the entry with your last name in bold to indicate that you selected the paper.
